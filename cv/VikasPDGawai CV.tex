\item Early-Life Economic Conditions and Old-Age Mortality: Evidence from Historical County-Level Bank Deposit Data, \textit{with Valentina Duque, Jason Fletcher, Hamid Noghanibehambari, Lauren Schmitz}-  \textbf{(\textit{Journal of Population Economics, January 2024)}}
\iffalse \textbf{Abstract-}
This paper studies the long-run mortality effects of in-utero and early-life economic conditions. We examine
how local economic conditions experienced in the Great Depression, proxied by county-level banking
deposits during in-utero and first years of life, can influence old-age longevity. We find that a one-standard-deviation rise in per capita bank deposits is associated with an approximately 2.8 months increase in
longevity at old ages (a 0.4 percent increase with respect to the outcome mean). The effects are robust across
a wide array of specification checks. Additional analyses comparing state-level versus county-level
economic measures provide insight into the importance of controlling for local-level confounders and
exploiting more granular measures in exploring the relationship between early-life conditions and later-life
mortality.

\item Discrimination in Science: Salaries of Foreign and US Born Land-Grant University Scientists  \textit{with Jeremy Foltz}
 \textbf{(Conditionally Accepted at \textit{American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE), July 2024})} %\textit{\scriptsize{%(Presentation - AAEA '22)}}
\iffalse\textbf{Abstract-} 
The dominance of the US innovation and academic system relies heavily on foreign-born labor for its success.
Recent literature has shown evidence of wage gaps in academia based on gender and race; however, little is known about whether a wage gap might exist for foreign-born faculty.
This paper studies the wage gap between the US and foreign-born agricultural and life science faculty at 52 US Land Grant Universities (LGU) using a survey of over 1,400 scientists conducted in 2005 and 2015.
We develop a framework to categorize the sources of a potential wage gap into testable categories that capture \textit{direct} discrimination as well as indirect (\textit{systemic}) discrimination.
We find that among the tenure-track faculty, foreign-born earn about 4\% or \$5,200 lower annual wages even though, on average, foreign-born scientists work more hours per week and produce about 52\% more journal articles than US-born scientists. The estimated wage gap is robust to a range of alternative empirical specifications.
The decomposition analysis suggests that about one-third of the wage gap is due to direct discrimination, and about two-thirds is due to various types of systemic discrimination.
Using our framework, we then rule in and rule out some important types of systemic discrimination.
Estimates from this paper are crucial for understanding potential policies that could improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in US academia.

\item Does High-Speed Internet (Broadband) Technology Affect the Mental Health of Older Adults? \textit{\scriptsize{(Presentations - MEA '23, American University '23, SEA '23, APPAM '23); Media Highlight: \href{https://grow.cals.wisc.edu/departments/features/the-road-to-rural-broadband}{GROW MAGAZINE cover story}}} 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Abstract-} 
Recent research has shown the negative effects of the internet on younger people's mental health. Yet, we do not know whether the same effects are present among the older population, who are especially vulnerable to certain mental health conditions and more likely to fall victim to online deception.
I estimate the effect of broadband availability on the mental health of the 50+ age group in the United States from 2010 to 2018.
I use individual panel data and exploit quasi-experimental variation induced by the staggered rollout of broadband at the census tract level using the latest difference-in-differences (DID) framework.
Despite evidence of the internet's harmful effects on younger populations, I show that broadband rollout significantly improves older adults' mental health, reducing depression symptoms by 5.7\%.
Key mechanisms driving these positive gains include a decline in feelings of social isolation and loneliness and an increase in the quality of virtual social connections.
Whites, rural dwellers, women, and married individuals appear to be the biggest beneficiaries of broadband's positive effects on mental health.
This work highlights broadband's unmeasured additional benefits to public investments, given the recent allocation of over $\$$65 billion to broadband expansion.
